## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In addressing climate change, we are studying the precipitation in Canadian cities as it has a direct, positive correlation with the rising temperature of our atmosphere. The data set we chose is the Canadian Climate History published by the Canadian Government. Through this data set, we can observe the average and total precipitation of Canadian cities in all provinces at midnight every day from 1970 up to 2020. The Canadian Climate History data is recorded by the Environment Canada network using automated weighing gauges, Geonor and Pluvio, that logs the precipitation through the weight changes at a given period (Government of Canada, 2018). The columns of the data set present the precipitation trend, demonstrating the country's change in temperature. To illustrate, as our atmosphere's temperature increases, more moisture and water are absorbed from the land; therefore, more rain will fall. Therefore, our data set's observation can indirectly illustrate the changes in temperature in the country.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Climate change is a global issue; however, understanding changes that are happening directly to the environment that we are living in may be an affective way to increase moral and instigate positive change. To tackle this topic, we wanted to find a dataset that had different measures of climate (i.e. temperature and precipitation) and could be directly related to our personal experience as people living in Canada. Our dataset does just this. It contains average precipitation and temperature values from 13 different Canadian cities over the span of 50 years (1970-2020). With this dataset we hope to find if trends exist that showcase a nationwide change in temperature and alterations to precipitation patterns. We also hope to use this data to investigate what the future might look like; we will utilize different methods to predict potential changes based on the data in this dataset. Our final goal is to make a visually appealing and digestible dashboard that displays the results we find in an interactive way.
