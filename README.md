## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In addressing climate change, we are studying the precipitation in Canadian cities as it has a direct, positive correlation with the rising temperature of our atmosphere. The data set we chose is the Canadian Climate History published by the Canadian Government. Through this data set, we can observe the average and total precipitation of Canadian cities in all provinces at midnight every day from 1970 up to 2020. The Canadian Climate History data is recorded by the Environment Canada network using automated weighing gauges, Geonor and Pluvio, that logs the precipitation through the weight changes at a given period (Government of Canada, 2018). The columns of the data set present the precipitation trend, demonstrating the country's change in temperature. To illustrate, as our atmosphere's temperature increases, more moisture and water are absorbed from the land; therefore, more rain will fall. Therefore, our data set's observation can indirectly illustrate the changes in temperature in the country.
